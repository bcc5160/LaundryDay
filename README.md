# LaundryDay
IST 437

Our Internet of Things (IoT) project is to provide an online interface for users who do laundry in a communal setting. There is a payment option as well as a timer and alert system.

This webpage is the front-end for an IoT project where a user can be alarmed when their wash is done.
